    <h2>The Long Bio</h2>
    <p>Hey there! I'm Aastha, a UX designer with a passion for human-centered innovation that blends technology,
        psychology, and social impact. I'm currently a senior at UMass Amherst, majoring in Computer Science with a
        minor in Psychology and a certificate in Public Interest Technology. I lead the Public Interest Technology Club,

    <p>With a deep curiosity for how people interact with the world, I aim to design solutions that not only meet user
        needs but also empower and inspire positive change. I'm excited to bring my diverse background and
        epistemophilic drive to projects that bridge technology and humanity.</p>

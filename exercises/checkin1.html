    <h1 id="C1">Design Thinking Process</h1>
    <p>Design thinking is a non-linear, iterative process that teams use to understand users, challenge assumptions, redefine problems and create innovative solutions to prototype and test <a href="https://www.interaction-design.org/literature/topics/design-thinking">(Interaction Design Foundation - IxDF. (2016, May 25)).</a> </p>

    <h2>What is the Design Thinking Process?</h2>
    <h3>The five process:</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Empathize</li>
        <li>Define</li>
        <li>Ideate</li>
        <li>Prototype</li>
        <li>Test</li>
    </ol>
    <h2>Why does it matter?</h2>
    <p>The first rule of this process is to design for the user. A lot of the times, people blame themseleves for not being able to use a device or an application correctly. When in fact, it's the design's fault. Design thinking process helps the designers to think of these challenges that might be faced by their target users and avoid or solve such problems. By using this process, one can even navigate accessibility issues, making it inclusive for everyone!</p>
